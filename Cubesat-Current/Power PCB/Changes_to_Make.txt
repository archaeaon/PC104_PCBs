r10, r15, r5, r3, r8, r13 are wrong size - too big
might need to do thermistors by hand
check text orientation
r10, r5, r15, may need to be flipped to keep side connected to transistor on same side
text size
maybe flip c2, c4, c6. c9, c11, c13. c16, c18, c20
r6, c9, (and other) label placements
move q5 label down
make pin 1 location more obvious
increase font size for /SMBA, SCL, etc
for connectors, make all squares GND or something
remove the +'s from the battery connector footprints and have a + and - indicating pos and neg
remove BT1, BT2, ... from the silk screen
remove H1, H2, ... from silk screen
battery connectors need to be spaced out more and maybe removed
check if d6 etc. is the wrong kind and put on 606
visually separate Bat1, Bat2, circuitry

100u caps are 0805
secondary voltage reg IC diodes are SOD-882

make IC pads and transistor pads longer
